# Chunes

Creates a list of new music from different subreddits

To do:

-Change the way users can find new tracks so instead of typing their genre, they just select what they want out of a list

-This will allow me to add more subgenres that would fit the main genre and use more sources 

-Add abackend to allow users to create a profile to save their tracks 
   



Known issues:

-Posts that contain a genre as a substring (POPular) are pushed through

-Very inefficient run-time
