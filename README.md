# Chunes

Creates a list of new music from different subreddits

To do:

-Add more information per song (# of upvotes, matching genre)

-Allow sorting by title, upvotes, genre

-Re factor logic

-Add more subreddits depending on genre (popheads, indieheads, etc.)

-Include Mongo to allow user to save songs they like


Known issues:

-Posts that contain a genre as a substring (POPular) are pushed through

-Very inefficient run-time
